I am a researcher in applied category theory. I have used categories to study quantum theory and more general theories of physical processes, including:
* reconstructions of quantum theory from simple categorical principles;
* formalisations of operational physical theories and quantum protocols;
* categorical models of spatiality and causality.

I am also interested in pure category theory. More recently I have been studying categorical approaches to natural
language processing, cognition and consciousness.


## Biography

I completed my BA and MMath in Mathematics at Cambridge and DPhil in the [Quantum Group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/quantum/) in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford supervised by [Bob Coecke](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/) and [Chris Heunen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cheunen/). My thesis was titled [Categorical Operational Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00343).  

From 2018 to 2019 I held postdoctoral positions in the Oxford Quantum group and the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. 

Since December 2019 I have been a researcher in the Oxford branch of [Cambridge Quantum Computing](https://cambridgequantum.com/about/).
