I am a research scientist in the Compositional Intelligence team at [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/). In my research I like to apply category theory and string diagrams to formalise various topics across science, including: 

* Quantum foundations 
* Interpretability of artificial intelligence 
* Causal reasoning 
* Models of cognition, including conceptual spaces and active inference 
* Theories of consciousness such as Integrated Information Theory 

I am also a founding member of the [Association for Mathematical Consciousness Science](https://amcs-community.org/members/).  


<!-- 
I have used categories to study quantum theory and more general theories of physical processes, including:
* reconstructions of quantum theory from simple categorical principles;
* formalisations of operational physical theories and quantum protocols;
* categorical models of spatiality and causality.

I am also interested in pure category theory. More recently I have been studying categorical approaches to natural language processing, cognition and consciousness.  -->
